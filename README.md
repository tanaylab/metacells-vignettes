# Metacells Vignettes

These vignettes give examples for using the [metacells](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacells), specifically version
0.9.

## View the results

You can directly view the vignettes here:

* [One Pass Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/htmls/one-pass.html)
* [Iterative Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/htmls/iterative.html)
* [Projection Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/htmls/projection.html)

## Re-run the vignettes

If you want to run the vignettes yourself, `git clone` this repository. Then, create a `blobs` sub-directory, download
the (zipped) [hca\_bm.full.h5ad](https://TODOX/hca_bm.full.h5ad.zip) and
[blood\_aging.full.h5ad](https://TODOX/blood_aging.full.h5ad.zip) files into it, and unzip them. This will take ~5GB of
disk space (unzipped).

Assuming you have the Python [metacells](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacells) package and the R
[MCView](https://github.com/tanaylab/MCView) package installed, you should be able to run the Jupyter notebooks
contained here yourself.

Alternatively, you could copy these notebooks and adapt them to use your own data, using them as a guide.
