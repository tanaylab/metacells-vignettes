# Metacells Vignettes

These vignettes give examples for using the [metacells](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacells), specifically version
0.9.0. They are not meant as a comprehensive documentation of all the features, and the data contained in them should
**not** be used for any serious analysis. They are just examples of the processes that one typically uses when using the
metacells package for analysis of scRNA-seq data.

## View the results

You can directly view the vignettes here:

* [One Pass Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/one-pass.html)
* [Iterative Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/iterative.html)
* [Projection Process](https://tanaylab.github.io/metacells-vignettes/projection.html)

## Re-run the vignettes

You will need the following software to be installed:

* The Python [metacells](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacells) package, of course.

* The Python `seaborn` package for generating graphs. Just `pip install seaborn`.

* An R environment.

* The R [MCView](https://github.com/tanaylab/MCView) package installed in it. See the installation instructions in the
  package (it is *not* a standard CRAN package).

* And, of course, a Jupyter setup that can access both the Python and R environments.

To get the Jupyter notebook sources, just `git clone` this repository. You can adapt the notebooks to use your own data,
of course. If you want to reproduce them, you'll need to get the data as well:

* First, `cd` into the cloned repository.

* Then, `wget https://metacells-vignette.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/blobs.tgz` to get the data files. This will download ~1GB of data.

* Finally, `tar xvzf blobs.tgz` which will extract the data files into the `blobs` directory, requiring ~6GB of disk space.

The data in these files comes from the following sources:

* Human Cell Atlas Bone Marrow Data from
  [here](https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects/cc95ff89-2e68-4a08-a234-480eca21ce79?catalog=dcp1).

* Blood aging data from [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79363).
